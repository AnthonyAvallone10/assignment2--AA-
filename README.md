## Penguin Data Analysis 

In my .do file, I 
	- captured the log
	- imported the penguins CVS file 
	- cleaned the data set restringing variables and replacing missing values 
	- Ran three descriptive statistics summarizing main data of the penguins for species, 	
	sex and island

## How to Reproduce 

	- Clone the repository 
	- Open the .do file with the Stata script 
	- The analysis results will be saved in the log that was captured
